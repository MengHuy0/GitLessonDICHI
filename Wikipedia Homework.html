    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Ugandan kobs are herbivores and feed largely on grasses and reeds. The females and young
        males form loose groups of varying size which range according to food availability, often moving along
        watercourses and grazing in valley bottoms. One group in South Sudan was recorded as travelling 150 to 200 km
        (93 to 124 mi) during the dry season. Sometimes non-breeding males form their own groups. Females become
        sexually mature in their second year, but males do not start breeding until they are older.</p>

    <p>Larger populations of kob tend to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek_mating">Lek mating</a>
        system, the females living in loose groups and only visiting the traditional breeding grounds in order to mate.
        For this purpose, males hold small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)">territorieds</a>
        of up to 200 m (660 ft) in diameter, the smallest territories being in the centre of crowded leks. Calving takes
        place at the end of the rainy season; a single calf is born in November or December, after a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation">gestation</a> period of about nine months.</p>
